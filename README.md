Coffee Bot
Welcome to Jordan’s cafe! This Python script simulates an interactive coffee ordering experience. Users can choose their preferred drink size, type, and milk for their latte.

How It Works
The coffee_bot() function initiates the coffee ordering process.
The get_size() function prompts the user to select a drink size (small, medium, or large). If an invalid input is provided, it displays an error message and asks again.
The get_drink_type() function asks the user to choose a drink type (brewed coffee, mocha, or latte). If the user selects latte, it calls the order_latte() function.
The order_latte() function further prompts the user to select the type of milk for their latte (2% milk, non-fat milk, or soy milk). If an invalid input is given, it displays an error message and asks again.
The print_message() function handles invalid selections by displaying an error message.

Usage
Run the script in your terminal or IDE.
Follow the prompts to select your drink size, type, and milk preference.
Enter your name when prompted.
The script will confirm your order and let you know that your drink will be ready shortly.
